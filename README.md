# MemeScraper

The name of my project is Meme Scraper and operates by scraping information from a specific website using JSoup. This was done in a team of three and we thought to use awesome memes that college students love. We scrape memes from the most popular section of the meme database knowyourmeme.com. The number of memes our program will scrape depends on you, the user (refer to our manual for more detailed instructions and important aspects you need to keep note of). There are different options you can choose to get information or interact with the meme scraper and database through user query and input. In addition, there is functionality that allows you to connect to a social network with fake bot friends in our program. Upon selecting the second function, you will be placed into a social network where you can get friend recommendations through similar meme interest (focal closure) and a meme recommendation through a friend (membership closure) where you have a set of friends we initialize for you. You can also input a meme of your choice and find new friends within the network that also like that meme and that will also give you a new friend recommendation.

The categories we use for our program are Social Networks and Document Search.
